# bouncing-dvd
## What
Creates a transparent window with a dvd logo bouncing on the screen, it's click-through so it should keep your computer completely useable but it doesn't cover the panel so if it bugs there's no problem.
## How
Using Python 2 or 3 I actually don't remember and even less care.
You know what? Just look at the code, it's mostly stolen anyway.
## How I
Only works on a decent Linux, and if you have a shitty hipster distribution, it might not work.
Just run ``python bouncing-dvd.py``, if it fails it'll probably show you the command to install python.
Even if it doesn't, you use Linux and you are on GitHub, you should know at least how to install something.
## Why
Because no one did it before, not that I know at least.
And because I want to throw my time away.
## Sucks
It does, but it's my sucks, and I love it.
You'd be surprised how easy it is to run this and forget it exists even though it's aways on your face.
## Windows
I also love Windows, I barely start up Linux, but the implementation for Windows would be completely different from what I understood.
I already spent enough time trying to make this work, I don't need to double it.
## Corner
Oh yeah, it's going to open your browser in a video where the dvd logo hits the corner every time it hits a corner, there's no way to disable it besides actually changing the code, happy days.
## Extras
There's some shit like ``python bouncing-dvd.py speed=20``, but there'll be no guide to the 2 or 3 things you can do with this.
## Can I
Yes, you can.
Unless you meant something related to me, then no, you can't.
